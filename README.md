## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform comprehensive DNA methylation analysis using EMSeq data derived from liquid biopsy samples of pediatric tumors. Analyses include read alignment, quality control, differential methylation region (DMR) detection, and copy number variation (CNV) calling.
